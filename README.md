## Project Overview
We were tasked to complete functionality of the game of Slap Jack using html, css, and vanilla JavaScript. We were provided with a basic template for the comp, and several pieces of functionality to complete.

I chose to make this game personal, using myself and my son as the players (both in the DOM as well as in the code). I did this because my son is a vital reason for attending Turing and chosing to change my career at the point of my life.
I do realize that it is better to make the code and the DOM representation more generic for other players. I added an issue to this repo to reflect my realization and acknowledgment of this. I hope to come back to this project at some point and refactor and update it!

## Goals
My goal was to meet all the specs of the project, including local storage, to demonstrate how much I have learned in my short time at Turing!

## Technologies
My Slap Jack game was built from scratch using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, chrome dev tools.

## Challenges
Making my code SRP and DRY was quite a challenge on this project. I was able to get functionality of my game going pretty quickly, but refactoring took up the vast majority of my time alloted for this project.

## Wins
I greatly enjoyed this project. Not only was I able to complete the project as close to the spec as I was possibly able, I also got to play this game with my son for real!

Big thanks to my mentor, Taras! https://github.com/ttarlov <br />
He was starting a new job as I worked on this project. Although he was not able to comment on my pull requests as much as he wanted, he made time to go over code and give me tips. I am very grateful!)
